### **Functional Requirements**  
The company aims to invest in its own infrastructure due to concerns about user data privacy and the rising costs of managed services for Generative AI.  

To achieve this, they plan to purchase an AI PC with a budget of $10,000–$15,000. The company currently serves 100 active students, all of whom are globally located.  

### **Assumptions**  
- The selected open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) should be capable of running efficiently on hardware within the allocated budget.  
- A single server in the office will be connected to the internet, and the available bandwidth is expected to be sufficient for supporting 300 students.  

### **Data Strategy**  
- Due to concerns regarding copyrighted materials, all necessary resources will be legally acquired, stored, and managed in a dedicated database for student access.  

### **Considerations**  
- DeepSeek-R1 is being considered as the preferred LLM due to its fully open-source nature, transparent training data, and traceable origins, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations and providing greater insight into the model’s functionality.
