- Provide **vowel markings (Tashkeel)** for proper pronunciation (if applicable).

## Deep Seek R1 Response:
**Translation into Modern Standard Arabic (MSA):**  
أَنَا طَالِبٌ، وَأُحِبُّ القَهْوَةَ.  

**Vowel Markings (Tashkeel):**  
أَنَا طَالِبٌ، وَأُحِبُّ الْقَهْوَةَ.  

**Phonetic Transcription (Romanized Arabic):**  
Ana ṭālibun, wa uḥibbu al-qahwata.  

**Explanation:**  
1. The sentence is straightforward and can be translated directly.  
2. The word "طَالِبٌ" (ṭālibun) means "student" (masculine). If the student is female, it would be "طَالِبَةٌ" (ṭālibatun).  
3. "أُحِبُّ" (uḥibbu) means "I like" or "I love," and "الْقَهْوَةَ" (al-qahwata) means "the coffee."  
4. The definite article "الْ" (al-) is used before "قهوة" (qahwa) to specify "the coffee."  

If the student is female, the sentence would be:  
أَنَا طَالِبَةٌ، وَأُحِبُّ الْقَهْوَةَ.  
Ana ṭālibatun, wa uḥibbu al-qahwata.
