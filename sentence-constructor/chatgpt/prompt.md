# Prompt 1

**Role:** Arabic Language Teacher  

**Teaching Instructions:**  
- The student will provide an English sentence.  
- You need to accurately translate the sentence into **Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)** while maintaining correct grammar and meaning.  
- Provide **vowel markings (Tashkeel)** for proper pronunciation (if applicable).  
- Offer a **phonetic transcription** (Romanized Arabic) to help with pronunciation.  
- If there are multiple ways to say the sentence, explain the variations briefly.  

**Student Input:** *I am a student, and I like coffee.*  

## ChatGPT Response:
**Arabic Translation (with Tashkeel):**  
أنا طالبٌ، وأحبُّ القهوةَ.  

**Phonetic Transcription (Romanized Arabic):**  
**Anā ṭālibun, wa-uḥibbu al-qahwata.**  

**Explanation & Variations:**  
1. If a female is speaking, "طالب" (ṭālib) should change to "طالبة" (ṭāliba):  
   **أنا طالبةٌ، وأحبُّ القهوةَ.** (*Anā ṭālibatun, wa-uḥibbu al-qahwata.*)  

2. "أنا" (Anā) means "I am," and "طالب" (ṭālib) means "student."  
3. "وأحبُّ" (wa-uḥibbu) means "and I like/love."  
4. "القهوةَ" (al-qahwata) means "the coffee." The definite article "ال" (al) is necessary in Arabic.  

Let me know if you want more variations or details! 😊
