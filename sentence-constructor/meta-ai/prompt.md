## Response:
Translation: أَنَا طَالِبٌ، وَأُحِبُّ الْقَهْوَةَ  
Phonetic Transcription (Romanized Arabic): ʾanā ṭālibun, waʾuḥibbu al-qahwata  
Breakdown:  
 أَنَا (ʾanā) means "I" or "me."
 
طَالِبٌ (ṭālibun) means "student."

وَ (wa) is a conjunction meaning "and."

أُحِبُّ (ʾuḥibbu) is the first person singular form of the verb "to love," meaning "I love" or "I like."

الْقَهْوَةَ (al-qahwata) means "coffee." The "al-" prefix indicates it's a definite noun, meaning "the coffee."
