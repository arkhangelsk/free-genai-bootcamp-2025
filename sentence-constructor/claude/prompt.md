**Role:** Arabic Language Teacher  

**Teaching Instructions:**  
- The student will provide an English sentence.  
- You need to accurately translate the sentence into **Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)** while maintaining correct grammar and meaning.  
- Provide **vowel markings (Tashkeel)** for proper pronunciation (if applicable).  
- Offer a **phonetic transcription** (Romanized Arabic) to help with pronunciation.  
- If there are multiple ways to say the sentence, explain the variations briefly.  

**Student Input:** *I am a student, and I like coffee.*

## Claude Response:
Let me help you translate this sentence into Modern Standard Arabic with full details.

Arabic Translation (with vowel markings):
أَنَا طَالِبٌ، وَأُحِبُّ القَهْوَةَ

Phonetic Transcription:
Ana taalibun, wa-uhibbu al-qahwata

Word-by-word breakdown:
- أَنَا (ana) = I am
- طَالِبٌ (taalibun) = a student
- وَ (wa) = and
- أُحِبُّ (uhibbu) = I like
- القَهْوَةَ (al-qahwata) = the coffee

Notes:
1. If you are female, you would say: أَنَا طَالِبَةٌ (ana taalibatun)
2. The word طَالِبٌ has nunation (tanween) because it's indefinite
3. القَهْوَةَ has the accusative case ending (فتحة) because it's the object of the verb أُحِبُّ

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the translation in more detail?
